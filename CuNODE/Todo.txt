CuNODE next steps for mems rig

GUI:
menu with precision, solver, maybe some other bullshit tidied away up there.
better yet: data picker
fix log tick zooimng and clash w axis label

ODE solver:

Template solver class that contains algorithm kernel to be passed to a builder function - test whether we can cuda compile a passed function reference
solveralgo(inits, dxdt(contains control), dt, fs, noise_sigmas=None (build zeros array length of dxdt),
consider whether to have a builder kernel per solver or just a kernel per?
implement "chunking" as implemented on fft system


Control equation options
rk4
adjustable step size algo
Grid with different control schemes - can't pass a function to kernel so need to figure out how to crack this one
figure out instruction parallelisation
