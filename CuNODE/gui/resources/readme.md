**QT GUI**
The GUI for this project has been designed largely in QT Designer, to celebrate that I no longer have to do eveything in code like in TKInter.
There are several design .ui files that form part of this project, in an attempt to encapsulate the various controller/view functions that the GUI performs.

*Custom QT Widgets**

Custom widgets have been created in QT Designer, generating a .ui file each.
Signals/slots are defined multiple times to allow connections in the designer
- Once in the custom widget file. This includes internal slots, external slots, and external signals
- Once in the parent widget, on the "placeholder" promoted widget.
- Again in the python file that controls the widgets behaviour.

All .ui files can be built into .py files using the build_ui.py script in the top directory.
Behaviour/source files for widgets are under the "widgets" directory, whereas .ui and autogenerated .py files are in the "qtdesigner" directory.
