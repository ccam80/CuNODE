**Sim controller**
implement init & noise sweeps.
lock solve button if no sys loaded
launch solver in thread

**Plotter**
set labels in a separate function that can be reused
get picker data back to plot control frame for single set slicing
Rework single staate entirely
consider removing z slice option - it's just zoom
rework spec and grid to match time3d formate, ready for animation
add pausable/stoppable animation class - make slider live
widget-ise the slider and animate bar for setting/getting entry box values

**View**
scale grid
log scale
control bar
picker
animation step through slider

**Toplevel**
Start by passing sim params to system for solving, and passing plot state to plotter.
Autopopulate a menu with available solvers. Fancy solvers might require a modification of paramaeters in the guis. Figure out how to get em all in one place - perhaps classes in a soverkernels module.
- Get heirarchy of deactivating/activating controls by state sorted to stop users ordering illegal stuff
