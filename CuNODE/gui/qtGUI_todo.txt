**Sim controller**
implement init & noise sweeps.
lock solve button if no sys loaded
launch solver in thread

**Plotter**
set labels in a separate function that can be reused
get picker data back to plot control frame for single set slicing
Rework single state entirely
- individual settings for 2d phase, 3d phase,
consider removing z slice option - it's just zoom
widget-ise the slider and animate bar for setting/getting entry box values
animation pause button and logic - change text to pause, halt slider, change text to resume, revert at end

**View**
scale grid
log scale
control bar
picker


**Toplevel**
Autopopulate a menu with available solvers. Fancy solvers might require a modification of paramaeters in the guis. Figure out how to get em all in one place - perhaps classes in a soverkernels module.
- Get heirarchy of deactivating/activating controls by state sorted to stop users ordering illegal stuff

*Gui Roadmap:*
**Core Development**
Create and fold in animate slider widgets to allow multiple options
z-coords
create plot objects for 2d phase, 3d phase, spectrogram, time-domain
return picked data and display point
log error checking

**Nice to have**
Button disabling sequences
Solver launch in thread
Menu boxes for freq analysis settings, solvers.
