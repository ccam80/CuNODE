**Plot Controller**
Implement an auto-update of plot parameters when changing tabs.
Add plot state option - potentially labels in the system as well to present this in a sensible way
figure out how to send a data request without sending data
Add a "load_system" method that opoulates all lists and fields

**Sim controller**
implement init & noise sweeps.

**Plotter**
start with Grid3D - generate a structured mesh from data
set labels in a separate function that can be reused
get picker data back to plot control frame for single set slicing
figure out how to communicate animation requests.
I think labels should live in plotter, loaded by controller when we load a system.

**Toplevel**
Start by passing sim params to system for solving, and passing plot state to plotter.
Plot state interpretation and data requesting is the big hard one here I think.
Controller should ferry data between model, controllers, and glue.
Does SOLVER need to own SYSTEM?
